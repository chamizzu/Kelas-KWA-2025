# Unprotected admin functionality


https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality 

Go to the lab and view robots.txt by appending /robots.txt to the lab URL. Notice that the Disallow line discloses the path to the admin panel.
In the URL bar, replace /robots.txt with /administrator-panel to load the admin panel.
Delete carlos.
